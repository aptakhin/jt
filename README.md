Jt is small sandbox static-typed language without garbage collector. So, welcome to reinvents powered language!

## Example

	def double(a) {
	    a + a;
	}

Calculating `Ð°` type when use ```double```:

	x = double(3);
	> 6
	y = double("ab"); # Stil doesn't work, shame on me
	> "abab"

Also, imagine the great power of 4 basis types: integer, asci string, boolean and function!

## Compilation and other humdrum

Requires Python 2.7 or new 3+ already installed for development. That is install stuff, testing stuff and GYP project generator stuff. Not very bad C++11 compiler is a requirement too.

Code is almost cross-platform, except some debugging features. Currently testing platform:

- Windows 7 x64, MSVS 13 upd. 1 x86 compiler (Earlier compiler versions are not supported)

Call ```install.py``` to download prepared tool's binaries on Windows:

- GYP
- Ragel
- Bison
- LLVM assembler and interpreter

Install them manually on other platforms or stay tuned!

### Hints ()

It's Windows-only yet, but you can still use it as hint.

Use GYP to generate project files for your favourite environment/IDE:

	cd wintools
	gyp ..\jt.gyp --depth=proj\vs13\ --generator-output=..\proj\vs13\tmp -f msvs -G msvs_version=2013

Regenerating lexer (Ragel) and parser (bison) files after changing grammar:	
	
	cd wintools
	gen.bat

Or run something like this:
	
	cd wintools
	Ragel -o ../src/lexer_gen.cpp ../src/lexer.rl
	set BISON_PKGDATADIR=bison/
	bison -d -o ../src/parser_gen.cpp ../src/parser.y
